  ros_code_pub_and_sub_legacy



**This section is still a work-in-progress :-(**

The intention is to provide a step-by-step guide for a enabling a differential drive robot to rove around autonomously, covering:

* Computer vision and wheel odometry localisation feedback.
* Driving the main wheels over I2C communication.
* Path planning and finite-state-machine (FSM) cognition.
* Trajectory generation and trajectory tracking control.



In the meantime, the following is a workflow for :ref:`ros-code-pub-and-sub-legacy` (which is in contrast to the :ref:`ros-code-from-a-clean-slate` section that builds up a publisher and subscriber example from scratch.
